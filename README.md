# Car Make Recognition 
This is the intern project of Edmunds which use ML to help making smart recommendation.
We retrained a model based on tensorflow inception V3 model to recognize car make. 
Also, we designed a API for that model and deployed this model to AWS apache server. 
A user-friendly UI was built for a complete Web application.
